Version 1.0:
	Initial board, and player turn set up.
	Might make the board public so as to allow an interface wrapper later.



Possible Changes:
	Add character behavior, so as to disallow invalid movements.
	Allow, en passe and castling, probably not too horribly hard.
	Actually look up in depth chess rules.
	Allow the user admin options to change the board without using their turn.
	Allow a -h option to each piece which will highlight all movement options on the board.
