# SPCHess
Playing around with c++ again: a simple chess game.
I wanted to write a trivial project to get back into the feel of c++, and possibly teach myself something about chess.

The long term goals of this project are not expansive, so far, completing a playable chess game is the main vision.
Continuing past that,
		A non-console, gui/mobile wrapper is possible.
		As for the console wrapper, possibly implementing it into an irc script is possible.
